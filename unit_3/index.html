	<p> When our daughter was a little over a year old, I made a New Years Resolution that we would start eating dinners together as a family as much as possible. She had a broad palate as a baby, and I didn't want her to become a toddler who eats only noodles and white bread (though that phase might still be coming). Besides the fact that this now meant having dinner on the table by 6pm (a challenge in itself), I needed to find recipes that appealed to the whole family. I found myself combing the internet for recipes that could be: <br><br>
	<ul>
	<li> Made or prepped in advance (during naptime)</li>
	<li> Healthy, Flavorful, but easily adapted to a more sensitive palate</li>
	<li> Free of my daughters two allergens - fish and tahini</li>
	<li> We also eat very little meat, so most recipes are vegetarian</li>
	<li> Ideally, easy to clean up (i.e., not using every pot and pan in the kitchen)</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
